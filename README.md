# jQuery Mobile Validator

A simple JavaScript shiv for seamless integration of the [jQuery Validator plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) with the [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com) framework.

The insipiration for this shiv was the goofy placement of validator error labels inside of JQM select inputs. Right now, that's all that it fixes.

## Usage

Include the jquery.mobile.validator.js file after including the jquery.validator.js scripts. 

See the examples directory for before and after examples.
